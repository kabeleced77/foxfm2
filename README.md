Mainly for developers or who wants to have the very last version :)

1. Install nodejs

2. Run npm install

3. Run jspm install -y

4. Run typings install

5. Run ./node_modules/.bin/gulp export-<BROWSER> where <BROWSER> needs to be replaced either by firefox or chrome

   The newly created directories 'export-<BROWSER>' can be directly loaded into the browser. This might require some extra settings in the browser.
